# Meta-Adapted-Physics-guided-Denoiser-for-Impulse-Noise
MAPD is a hybrid impulse noise restoration framework. It fuses a lightweight MetaParameterNet for adaptive hyperparameter prediction, fractional spectral priors for texture preservation, and structure-aware clustering to achieve robust, high-fidelity denoising (PSNR >30dB at 60% noise) without end-to-end deep learning.
